# quark20-mml-store
In digital worlds, creators and artists are free from governance. Spirit0 came to me said that artists should have their own stores showcasing and selling their arts permissionless. This motivated me to build a 3D store infrastructure based on MML (describing spatial attributes of 3D objects), BlocksOfBitcoin (building 3D worlds on BTC blocks), and Nakamoto Matrix (crosschain interoperable digital world playground on web/unreal engine).

Here are a few stores to showcase where we are:

- [chapy.blocksofbitcoin.xyz](http://chapy.blocksofbitcoin.xyz) (accepting BTC payments from Xverse)
- [spirit0.blocksofbitcoin.xyz](http://spirit0.blocksofbitcoin.xyz) ((accepting BTC payments from Xverse)
- [runeape.blocksofbitcoin.xyz](http://runeape.blocksofbitcoin.xyz) (accepting BTC payments from Xverse and $qAI SOL tips from Phantom. Both works in Xverse or Phantom mobile app)

## Quick Start

You can build and publish your 3D store page using ARC and MML. Note that MML is interoperable with other MML-based 3D world such as Yuga Labs OtherSide or any Improbable/M-Squared projects.

1. [free] go to ARC using desktop Chrome browser and check out the automated MML tutorial through experiential learning. You need basic idea of 3D coordinates and how to place 3D objects in desired locations with correct modifications of rotation and scale. Check out related XML and MML resources. 
2. To save your MML works, you need to sign-in with your Xverse wallet that owns Nakamoto Matrix (total supply: 798) for at least one day. For $qAI holders, they can sign-in with Phantom
3. To publish your MML works into a 3D store with a designated web page, you need to enclose your MML document as `<m-store> ...your MML... </m-store>` where `<m-store>` is at the beginning and ending with `</m-store>` 
4. To debug MML, use XML formatter for checking basic syntax errors (or ask AI?)

## m-store

This is a new tag we defined that currently only works in Quark20 ecosystem. Follow the instructions to configure and customize your store.

## Store management

There is a minimum store order management system where the store owner (and storeAdmin) can see a list of valid payments. Note that this is a self-served store infrastructure so store owners need to ship the orders themselves.

## Nakamoto Matrix Holders

We are grateful to build and grow with every one of you! Please join our Discord for guided tours and try out our AI tools to assist you for building your digital worlds on Bitcoin.

## Roadmap

This is a public alpha preview. Weâ€™ve been experimenting the best format and structure for building durable digital worlds. With the help of AI, building and growing your dream store would be easier overtime. Here are my work-in-progress items:

- dynamic and real-time live store assets based on Discord/Twitter activities
- integrated text/image-to-3D asset generation pipeline
- custom domains for store owners
- whole store generation with qAI
- NEXT LEVEL upgrades (currently in maintenance mode)
- native multiplayer support in store mode
- spatial qAI APIs with x402 USDC (SOL) payment with $qAI buyback
